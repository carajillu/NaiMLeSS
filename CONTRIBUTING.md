# Contributing to # N*ai*MLeSS

## Code style

We use the [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) code formatter with default settings and the flake8 linter with settings:
```
--ignore=E226,E501,E741,E743,C901,W503,E203 --max-line-length=127
```

## Code Structure

N*ai*MLeSS is developed with a strong emphasis on modularity, so community conbtributions can and should be implemented by only adding the relevant 
files, without modifying the rest of the project.
